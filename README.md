# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning algorithms from scratch. The goal is to understand the core concepts behind these algorithms by implementing them without relying on external libraries.

## Algorithms Included
- K-Means Clustering
- Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
- Descision Tree

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AnisH521/ml_algo.git
   cd algo
   ```
2. Ensure Python is installed.

## Usage
Run any algorithm script directly in Python:
```sh
python kmeans.py
python hierarchical_clustering.py
```
